# Acids

\ch{HCl} and \cl{HNO3} are *monobasic* acids as they donate one \ch{H+} ion.

$$
\ch{HNO3 -> H+ + NO3-}
$$

H2SO4 is a dibasic acid as it donates two H^+ ions

H2SO4 --> 2H+ + SO4^{2-}

H3PO4 is a tribasic acid as it donates three H+ ions

H3PO4 --> 3H+ + PO4^{3-}

## Common Laboratory Bases

Sodium Hydroxide NaOH
Calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2
Ammonia NH3
Sodium Carbonate Na2CO3
## Neutralisation

The reaction between an acid and a base produces salt and water

HCl + NaOH --> NaCL + H2O

A salt is formed when the hbydrogen if an acud us reolaced by a metal

# Arrhenius Theory of Acid

* Arrhenius was a swedish chemist
* Put forward a theory of acids in the 1800s

An arrhenius acid is a substance that dissociates in water to form H^+ ions. ** THIS CAN COME UP **

Example: when HCl is added to water

HCl --> H+ + CL-

General 

HA --> H+ + A^-

## Strong Acids

\begin{definition}{Strong Acid}
A strong acid is one which dissociates fully in water.
\end{definition}

Example:

HCl, H2SO4, 
HCL + H2O --> H3O^+ + Cl^-

## Weak Acids

\begin{definition}{Weak Acid}
An acid that does not fully dissociate in water
\end{definition}

Examples:

CH3COOH (ethanoic acid)

CH3COOH + H2O <--> H3O+ + CH3COO-

Note the <--> is Equlibrium arrow, can go both ways.

# Arrhenius Theory of Bases

\begin{definition}{Arrhenius Base}
An arrhenius base is a substance that dissociates in water to produce OH^- ions.
\end{definition}

For example: When NaOH is added to water:

NaOH --> Na+ + OH-

General:

XOH --> X+ + OH-

## Strong Base

A strong base is one which dissociates fully in water

NaOH

## Weak Base

A weak base is one which doesd not fully dissociate in water

Mg(OH)2

# Evidence for Arrhenius Theory

* Explains why strong acids conduct electricity when dissolved in water (No ions in pure acid)
NOTE: Pure acids to not conduct because the ions cannot move.

* Exolains why weak acid does not conduct as well as strong acid (fewer ions in weak)

* Acids normally need water before they show acidic properties (put in water), this is not true.

## Limitations of Arrhenius Theory

1. The definitions only work in water - Acids and bases must be in aqueous solutions.
2. Whern an acid dissolved in water the hydroinium ion is formed (\ch{H3O^+}) rather than the hydrogen ion. 
3. Theory doesn't explain how certain substances are *amphoteric* (a substance that acts either as an acid or a base, depending on what they are with. Water is one of them).


# Brønsted-Lowry

\begin{definition}{Brønsted-Lowry acid}
A proton donor.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Brønsted-Lowry base}
A proton acceptor.
\end{definition}


## Acid 
To show how this workis, they looked at how acids work in water

$$
\ch{HCl + H2O -> H3O^+ + Cl-
$$

Note that the charges on the H3O and Cl show how a proton has been donated from HCl and accepted into H3O+

## Base

$$
NH3 + H2O -> NH4+ + OH-
$$


The \ch{NH3} accpets a proton and so is a base.
The H2O, in  this case, donates a proton and so is an acid.
