# Chemical Compounds

\begin{definition}{Compound}

A compound is a substance that is made up of two or more elements combined together chemically.

\end{definition}

## Noble Gases

* Nobel gases have full outer shells.
* Stable and non-reactive.
* All nobel gases (excluding helium) have 8 electrons in their valence shells (outermost energy levels)
* Some example usage 

## The Octet Rule

* Stable compounds are wanted in chemistry.
* This is done by having 8 electrons in their outermost energy levels (valence shells).

\begin{definition}{Octet Rule}
When bonding occurs, atoms tend to reach an electron arrangement with eight electrons in their outermost energy level.
\end{definition}

* Not a law, rather a `rule of thumb'.
* There are some exceptions
  * Transition metals - they have more or less than 8 electrons in their outermost energy level
  * Elements near helium (hydrogen, lithium and beryllium) tend to have 2 electrons, rather than 8

# Ionic Bonding

\begin{definition}{Ion}
A charged atom or group of atoms
\end{definition}

* A Positively charged ion is a *cation*.
* A negatively charged ion is a *anion*.

\begin{definition}{Ionic Bond}
The \textbf{electrostatic} force of attraction between oppositely charged ions in a compound.
\end{definition}

* Ionic bonding generally occurs between metals and non-metals.
* These compounds are generally quite stable, and often come in crystalline form such as salts.

The purple spheres are sodium cations (\ch{Na^+}), and the green spheres represent chloride anions (\ch{Cl^-})\label{fig:lattice}](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png/253px-Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png)

* This structure, the three-dimensional arrangement of ions, is called a *crystal lattice*.
* In figure \ref{fig:lattice}, the repeating unit in the crystal lattice is shown. This is called the *unit cell*.
* In the crystal lattice of \ch{NaCL}, each chloride ion is surrounded by six sodium ions, and vice versa.

## Uses of Ionic Compounds

* Sodium chloride to preserve and flavour food.
* Brine to cure bacon.
* Flouridation of water supplies to prevent tooth decay.

## Showing Ionic Bonding

The usual way of showing the formation of the ionic bonding in a compound is using *dot-and-cross diagrams*.

\begin{figure}[h]

\scalebox{1.5} {
\ch{"\chlewis{0.}{Na}" + "\chlewis{0:90:180.270:}{Cl}" -> [Na]+ + [ "\chlewis{0:90:180:270:}{Cl}" ]-}
}

* In these diagrams, you can also draw the electrons from one atom as crosses, and show their transfer.
* The transfer of electrons is shown by the arrow.
