# Atomic Absorption Spectrometry

You need to be able to explain atomic absorption spectrometry and give some uses

# Sublevels

Before, bohr, electrons go in shells

$n = 1$, 2 electrons
$n = 2$, 8 electrons
.... (this was there in junior cert)

IN leaving cert you have a amore complicated verison of this

Wnen dicovered emsision line spectrums, supported above, however when studied spectrums, what looked like a single line of colored light, it was actually many close together.

The main energy levels are divided into sublevels.

The numner of sublevels is equal to $n$, ie. $n=1$ has 1 sublevel,

sublevels named: $s, p, d, f$, you will not use $f$

$s = 2, p = 6, d = 10$ (how many each sublevel can be called).


If $n = 1$, it has 1 sublevel, and it is named $s$. It is called $1s$ and can hold 2 electrons
$n = 2$, it has 2 sublevels, $2s$ and $2p$.
as $n =3$, it has 3 sublevels, $3s, 3p, 3d$,
$n=4$, 4 sublevels, $4s, 4p, 3d, 4f$ 


Electron occupy lowest available energy level first. $3d$ is higher then $4s$, and would be filled beforehand.

There are some exceptions!

If a sublevel is exactly half full, it will be extra stable.

Remember the two exceptions,

* Chromium (Cr) = 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p6, 4s1, 3d5 
* Copper (Cu) = 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p6, 4s1, 3d10

These two elements don't fill 4s, rather making it more stable.

## Example

Write the electron config for boron, 

Diagram page 19, fig. 3.17 - 4s is lower in energy than 3d. Sublevel h

$B = 1s^2, 2s^2, 2p^1$,

## Example 2

Nitrogen = 1s^2, 2s^2, 2p^3
Neon = 1s^2, 2s^2, 2p^6 
Aliminum = 1s^2, 2s^2, 2p^6, 3s^2, 3p^1
Potassium (19) = 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 2p6, 4s1
Copper (29) = 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p6 ,4s1, 3d10
