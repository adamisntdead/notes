# The Elements

\begin{definition}{Element}
An element is a substance that can't be split into simpler substances by chemical means.
\end{definition}

Robert Boyle - gave first accurate definition of an element:

`A simple substance that can't be broken into anything simpler`.


It's because of humphrey davy that discovered:
When you get a compound and pass electricity through through it, you break it down into it's elements.

Age 28 he discovered potassium and others (you don't need to know what he discovered)

They then wanted to organize the elements in some pattern.

Wanted to look for similarities - this was after humphrey.

Dobereiner - saw trends and similarities among groups of elements in threes (put elements in threes, triads). (mass of the middle is the average of the other two elements, this didn't work for all elements.)

Dovereiner - Classifying elements by their weights and properties.

John Newlands - Ordered increasing Atomic Weight, He noticed the properties repeated every 8 elements. **Law of octaves**. This created some problems, didn't realize some elements were not discovered, nobel gases were missing.

Mendeleev's - Increasing weight + properties. He looked at properties, which meant he left gaps in his table. Elements with similar properties were under each other. **Periodic Law**.

- To demonstrate the regular repetition of properties, he placed all elements with similar properties in the same vertical column
- Mendeleev left gaps in his table
- He predicted the properties of undiscovered elements
- Revered the order of some elements (Few cases, he reversed the order of elements in order to make them fall into groups of elements with similar properties - properties more important then weights, when atomic number came around, that fit perfectly)

Henry Moseley. Measured the number of protons in the nuclei of the atom (atomic number).
