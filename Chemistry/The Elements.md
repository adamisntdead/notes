# The Elements

\begin{definition}{Element}
An element is a substance that can't be split into simpler substances by chemical means.
\end{definition}

Robert Boyle - gave first accurate definition of an element:

`A simple substance that can't be broken into anything simpler`.


It's because of humphrey davy that discovered:
When you get a compound and pass electricity through through it, you break it down into it's elements.

Age 28 he discovered potassium and others (you don't need to know what he discovered)

They then wanted to organize the elements in some pattern.

Wanted to look for similarities - this was after humphrey.

Dobereiner - saw trends and similarities among groups of elements in threes (put elements in threes, triads). (mass of the middle is the average of the other two elements, this didn't work for all elements.)

Dovereiner - Classifying elements by their weights and properties.

John Newlands - Ordered increasing Atomic Weight, He noticed the properties repeated every 8 elements. **Law of octaves**. This created some problems, didn't realize some elements were not discovered, nobel gases were missing.

Mendeleev's - Increasing weight + properties. He looked at properties, which meant he left gaps in his table. Elements with similar properties were under each other. **Periodic Law**.

- To demonstrate the regular repetition of properties, he placed all elements with similar properties in the same vertical column
- Mendeleev left gaps in his table
- He predicted the properties of undiscovered elements
- Revered the order of some elements (Few cases, he reversed the order of elements in order to make them fall into groups of elements with similar properties - properties more important then weights, when atomic number came around, that fit perfectly)

**Henry Moseley** measured the number of protons in the nuclei of the atom (atomic number).

Mendeleev found that if you order by atomic number, you don't need to reverse, hence the modern periodic table.

## The Modern Periodic Table

Differences between mendeleev's table and the modern one

- Elements are arranged by **increasing atomic number** (not mendeleev's atomic weight)
- There are **more elements** in the modern table
- There are no gaps
- Transiton elements are listed in a seperate block

(Put in table 4.3)



## Using it

You will need to be able to:

- Obtain atomic numbers and mass numbers
- Obtainig relative atomic masses
- Writing electron configurations



## Mass number & Atomic Number

(Labeled picture of an element)

Mass number is always the bigger number.

Atomic nunber gives the number of protons

Every atom is neutral, thus there is the same number of protons and electrons.

To get the number of neutrons, take the number of protons from the mass number.

The mass number is the sum of the protons and neurons in the element. (the electron mass can be ignored).

### Relative Atomic Mass

Relative atomic mass is the average atomic mass of the isotopes of an elements



Francis William Aston developed the 'mass spectrometer'. He found that neon consisted of two varietioes of neon atoms. One type had a mass number of 20, the other had 22..

He called these **isotopes**.

\begin{definition}{Isotopes}

Isotopes are atoms of the same element which have different mass numbers due to the diferent number of neutrons in the nucleus.

\end{definition}
