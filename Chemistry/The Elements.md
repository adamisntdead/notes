# The Elements

\begin{definition}{Element}
An element is a substance that can't be split into simpler substances by chemical means.
\end{definition}

Robert Boyle - gave first accurate definition of an element:

`A simple substance that can't be broken into anything simpler`.


It's because of humphrey davy that discovered:
When you get a compound and pass electricity through through it, you break it down into it's elements.

Age 28 he discovered potassium and others (you don't need to know what he discovered)

They then wanted to organize the elements in some pattern.
