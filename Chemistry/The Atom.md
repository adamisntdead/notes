# The Atom

- The materials around us are made up of matter
- Matter can take 3 forms, solids, liquids and gases

## The first Atomic Theory

Atomic theory was first proposed by John Dalton, where he had the theory:

1. All matter is made up of very small particles called atoms
2. Atoms are indivisible (can't be broken down into smaller parts, which is wrong)

## Discovery of the Electron

### Crookes 'Maltese Cross' Experiment

- In 1875, William Crookes investigated what happens when electric current is passed through a glass tube containing air at low pressure
- He used a glass tube, with a cathode, an anode and an object, along with a high voltage power supply

- He found radiation from the cathode
- Shown by putting an object (a maltese cross) in the glass, which shows a 'shadow'
- Described these as cathode rays (which are rays of electrons)
- The cathode rays cause a glowing

### Crookes 'Paddle Wheel' Experiment

To investigate the properties of these cathode rays, crookes set up another experiment.

- A light paddle wheel was placed in front of the cathode
- When the current was switched on, the paddle wheel moved
- The wheels vanes always moved away
- The canes were being struck by particles, coming from the cathode

The following conclusions were drawn

- Cathode rays travel in straight lines
- Cathode rays cause the glasses phosphor coating to glow
- Cathode rays have enough energy to turn a paddle wheel

### Thomson's Cathode Ray Experiment

At the end of the 19th century, J.J. Thomson tried to resolve some outlying issues with cathode rays.
He constructed a cathode ray tube that allowed the use of two electrodes to show that the cathode rays had a negative charge.

From this Thomson proposed a **plum pudding** model of the atom

### Millikan's Oil Drop Experiment

After Thomson's experiment, it was not universally accepted that subatomic particles exist.
Millikan wanted to measure the charge of an electron (which could also give the mass).

- Tiny droplets of oil were sprayed between two charged metal plates.
- X-rays were used to ionise the air between the plates (the molecules in the air lost electrons and formed ions)
- When the oil droplets fell through the air they picked up these electrons, becoming negatively charged.
- Using a microscope, a particular oil droplet was focused on, and millikan observed that the negatively charged droplet was attracted to the positive plate.
- The charge of the plates were adjusted until the oil droplet was stationary, and the size of the electron's charge

### The Plum Pudding Model of the Atom

After his experiments, Thomson proposed a simple model of the atom:

- An atom like a sphere of positive
- Electrons are embedded in the sphere at random.
