# The Atom

- The materials around us are made up of matter
- Matter can take 3 forms, solids, liquids and gases

## The first Atomic Theory

Atomic theory was first proposed by John Dalton, where he had the theory:

1. All matter is made up of very small particles called atoms
2. Atoms are indivisible (can't be broken down into smaller parts, which is wrong)

## Discovery of the Electron

- In 1875, William Crookes investigated what happens when electric current is passed through a glass tube containing air at low pressure
- He used a glass tube, with a cathode, an anode and an object, along with a high voltage power supply

- He found radiation from the cathode
- Shown by putting an object (a maltese cross) in the glass, which shows a 'shadow'
- Described these as cathode rays (which are rays of electrons)
- The cathode rays cause a glowing
