# The Atom

\begin{definition}{Dalton's Atomic Theory}
This theory may be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item All matter is made up of very small particles called atoms.
\item All atoms are indivisible. They cannot be broken down into simpler particles.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Cathode Rays}
Streams of negatively charged particle called electrons. They travel in straight lines from the cathode to the anode, are deflected by electricity and magnetic fields, and have sufficient energy to move a small object such as a paddle wheel.
\end{definition}

# Arrangement of Electrons in the Atom

\begin{definition}{Energy Level}
The fixed energy value that an electron in an atom may have.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Ground State}
The ground state of an atom is one in which the electrons occupy the lowest available energy levels.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Excited State}
The excited state of an atom is one in which the electrons occupy higher energy levels than those available in the ground state.
\end{definition}
