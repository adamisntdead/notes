# The Atom

\begin{definition}{Dalton's Atomic Theory}
\begin{enumerate}
\item All matter is made up of very small particles called atoms.
\item All atoms are indivisible. They cannot be broken down into simpler particles.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Cathode Rays}
Streams of negatively charged particle called electrons. They travel in straight lines from the cathode to the anode, are deflected by electricity and magnetic fields, and have sufficient energy to move a small object such as a paddle wheel.
\end{definition}

# Arrangement of Electrons in the Atom

\begin{definition}{Energy Level}
The fixed energy value that an electron in an atom may have.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Ground State}
The ground state of an atom is one in which the electrons occupy the lowest available energy levels.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Excited State}
The excited state of an atom is one in which the electrons occupy higher energy levels than those available in the ground state.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Equation Of The Frequency Of Light}
$$
E_2 - E_1 = hf
$$

Where $h$ is planks constant and $f$ is the frequency of light.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle}
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle state that it is impossible to measure at the same time both the velocity and the position of an electron.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Orbital}
An orbital is a region in space where there is a high probability of finding an electron.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Sublevel}
A sublevel is a subdivision of a main energy level that consists of one or more orbitals of the same energy.
\end{definition}

# The Periodic Table

\begin{definition}{Element}
An element is a substance that cannot be split into a simpler substance by chemical means.
\end{definition} 

\begin{definition}{Isotopes}

Isotopes are atoms of the same element which have different mass numbers due to the diferent number of neutrons in the nucleus.

\end{definition}
