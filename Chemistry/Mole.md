# Development of a mole

* **Amedeo Avogadro** is responsible or the unit of measurement of particles and atoms.

\begin{definition}{Mole}
One mole of a substance is the amount of that substance tht contains $6 \times 10^{23}$ particles.
\end{definition}

# Molar Mass

* The **molar mass** of a substance is the mass in gram sof one mole of the substance.
* The molar mass has the same numerical value as it's relative molecular mass, but it's **units** are **grams(g)**.

## Calculating Molar Mass

* Add together the atomic masses of each atom in the compound.

\begin{example}{{Calculate the relative molecular mass of Sulfuric acid, \ch{H2SO4}.
}}
\Solution

$$Mr = \underbrace{(2 \times 1)}_H + \underbrace{(1\times 32)}_S + \underbrace{(4 \times 16)}_O = 98$$
\end{example}

\begin{example}{{A sulfur atom weights twice as much as an oxygen atom. 
If a chemist has 16 grams of oxygen atoms, how many grams of sulfur would contain the same number of atoms as in the sample of oxygen atoms?
}}
\Solution
It would be 32 grams, because each atom is twice as heavy.
\end{example}

## Converting Grams to Moles

$$
\text{No. of moles of an element} = \frac{\text{Mass of the element}}{\text{Relative atomic mass}}.
$$

**Note**: '*element*' can be interchanged for molecules or compounds, depending on the question.

\begin{example}{{How many moles are in 10 grams of \ch{H3PO4}?
}}
\Solution

\ch{H3PO4}
$$\text{Mr} = \underbrace{(3 \times 1)}_H + \underbrace{(1\times 31)}_P + \underbrace{(4 \times 16)}_O = 98\text{g}.$$

We have 10 grams, thus the number of moles is 

$$\frac{10}{98} = 0.1 \text{ Moles.}$$
\end{example}

\begin{example}{{How many moles are in 8g of Oxygen?
}}
\Solution

\begin{align*}
&\text{Mr } \ch{O2} = 32 \\
\implies &8/32 = 0.25\text{ moles}.
\end{align*}

\end{example}

\begin{example}{{How many atoms are present in 0.54 moles of carbon?
}}
\Solution
We want to go from moles to atoms, so multiply by $6 \times 10^{23}$.

$$
\text{Mr }0.54 \cdot (6 \times 10^{23}) = 3.24\times 10^{23} \text{ atoms}.
$$
\end{example}
