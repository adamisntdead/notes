# A Short History

\begin{definition}{Radioactivity}
The spontaneous breaking up of certain unstable nuclei, accompanied by the emission of radiation.
\end{definition}

* It can be said that the purpouse or radiation is to make an atom more stable.
* Radioactivity was first discovered by a French physicist called Henri Becquerel in 1896.
* A substance that gives off rays is said to be radioactive.
* Uranium was the first radioactive substance discovered.

## Marie Curie

* Pierre and Married Currie, 1898.
* Investigated the radioactivity of uranium salts. 
* Isolated radioactive isotopes.
* Discovered Polonium and Radium.
* Discovered Alpha, Beta and Gamma radiation.

\begin{definition}{Radioisotope}
A radioactive isotope
\end{definition}

# Radioactivity

* Radiation is emitted in three forms:
  * Alpha particles ($\alpha$)
  * Beta particles ($\beta$)
  * Gamma particles ($\gamma$) 

## Alpha Particles ($\alpha$)

* Consist of two protons and two neutrons, stuck together.
* Same as nucleus of a Helium atom.
* Therefore alpha particles can be represented as $^4_2 \ch{He}$.

* Emitted out of an unstable nucleus of a radioactive element as it becomes more stable.
* Example: Smoke detectors contain Americum-241 which is a source of radioactive alpha particles.

## Beta Particles ($\beta$)

* Just an electron.
* A beta particle is formed when an unstable neutron is changed into a proton and an electron, the electron is then emitted.
* Carbon-14 emits beta particles.

## Gamma Radiation ($\gamma$)

* Gamma radiation is a form of energy similar of X-Rays.
* Therefore it doesn't contain particles.
* An unstable nucleus emits gamma radiation to lose surplus energy.

* If it is absorbed in large quantities into the body it can alter chemicals in our bodies and cause cancer.
* It can also be used to kill cancer cells by focusing the gamma rays on specific areas of the body.
* Cobalt-60 gives off gamma rays.

| Radiation        | Stopped By   |
|------------------|--------------|
| Alpha ($\alpha$) | Paper        |
| Beta ($\beta$)   | 5mm Aluminum |
| Gamma ($\gamma$) | Thick Lead   |

# Decay

## Alpha Decay

\ch{^A_ZX -> ^{A - 4}_{Z - 2} Y + ^{4}_{2}He}

Z - atomic number and A is atomic mass.

## Beta Decay


\ch{^A_ZX -> ^{A}_{Z + 1}Y + _{-1}^{0}$\beta$}

# Nuclear Reactions vs. Chemical Reactions

| Chemical Reaction                       | Nuclear Reaction                                          |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Involves electrons rather than nucleus. | Changes take place in nucleus and electrons not involved. |
| No new element is formed.               | A new element is formed.                                  |
| No release of nuclear radiation.        | Nuclear radiation is released.                            |
| Chemical bonds broken and formed.       | No chemical bond breaking or bond formation involved.     |

# Half Life 

\begin{definition}{Half Life}
The time taken for half of the nuclei in any given sample to decay.
\end{definition}

* This occurs at different rates and different rates and different times for each elements.
* It is not a fixed process and not fully understood by scientists.
