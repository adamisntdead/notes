# Terms

\begin{definition}{Self-luminous}
Having in itself the property of emitting light.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Speed of Light}
The constant speed at which light travels when emitted from a source, around 300,000 kilometres per second
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Photocell}
An electronic component in a solar panel that produces electric current from light.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Crookes Radiometer}
A device that converts light energy into kinetic energy by moving a paddle wheel inside a glass jar.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Diverging Beam}
A beam of light that spreads out from a source at a different angle to other beams from the same source
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Converging Beam}
Beams of light that converge on, i.e. come to a common point, from the same source.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Parallel Beam}
Beams of light are parallel beams, which are beams that remain equidistant from one another as they are emitted from a source.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Reflection}
The phenomenon by which light bounces off a substance at a particular angle.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Diffuse Reflection}
Reflection where the beam being reflected bounces in all directions after being reflected.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Regular Reflection}
The reflection where the angle of incidence, i.e. the angle that the light hits the reflective substance, equals the angle of reflection.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Virtual Image}
An image formed by the **apparent intersection of Rays**.

A virtual image **cannot** be formed on a screen.
\end{definition}

# Laws Of The Reflection Of Light

1. The incident ray, the normal at the point of incidence and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane
2. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection (i = r)

# Images in Plane Mirrors

Images in plane mirrors have these properties

- Virtual
- Upright
- The same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror
