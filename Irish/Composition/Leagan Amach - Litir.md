# Leagan Amach - Litir

## 7 Steps To Writing A Letter

1. Seoladh - Your address (remember it's so the person receiving the letter can write back)
2. Dáta - Date
3. Beannú - Opening
4. Tús - Start, the introduction/general content
5. Corp - Body, the topic being asked about
6. Críoch - Finishing, a short paragraph to conclude the letter
7. Siniú - Closing salutation

**Remember:** You should use names such as Liam, Áine and Colm to avoid having to modify the names.

## Seoladh

You should only need 3 addresses, one for home, one for a gaeltacht/irish holiday, and one for a foreign holiday.

**Remember:** Every word in the address should be capitalized.

### Baile (Home)

```
3 Bóthar Nua,
Na Sceirí,
Baile Átha Cliath
```

### Gaeltacht (Irish Holday)

```
3 Bóthar Nua,
An Spidéal,
Co. Na Gaillimhe
```

###Saoire (Foreign Holiday)

```
3 Bóthar Nua,
Barcalona,
An Spáinn
```

**Note:** If you go with Barcelona, you can talk about being at the beach.
