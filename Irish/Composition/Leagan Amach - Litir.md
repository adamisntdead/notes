# Leagan Amach - Litir

## 7 Steps To Writing A Letter

1. Seoladh - Your address (remember it's so the person receiving the letter can write back)
2. Dáta - Date
3. Beannú - Greeting 
4. Tús - Start, the introduction/general content
5. Corp - Body, the topic being asked about
6. Críoch - Finishing, a short paragraph to conclude the letter
7. Siniú - Closing salutation

**Note:** You should use names such as Liam, Áine and Colm to avoid having to modify the names.

## Seoladh

You should only need 3 addresses, one for home, one for a gaeltacht/irish holiday, and one for a foreign holiday.

**Remember:** Every word in the address should be capitalized.

### Baile (Home)

```
3 Bóthar Nua,
Na Sceirí,
Baile Átha Cliath
```

### Gaeltacht (Irish Holday)

```
3 Bóthar Nua,
An Spidéal,
Co. Na Gaillimhe
```

### Saoire (Foreign Holiday)

```
3 Bóthar Nua,
Barcalona,
An Spáinn
```

**Note:** If you go with Barcelona, you can talk about being at the beach.

## Tús

Conas atá tú? Aon scéal agat dom? Go raibh maith agat as ucht an litir a sheol tú chugam le deanaí. Bhí áthas an domhain orm é a fhái. Tá brón orm nar scríobh mé níos luaithe ach bhí mé an-ghnóthach. Tá súil agam go bhfuil tú féin agus do chlann i mbarr na sláinte.



**Translation**: How are you? Any news for me? Thank you for the letter you sent me recently. I was delighted to get it. I am sorry I didn't write sooner, but I was very busy. I hope you and your family are well.

**Note:** You should add something extra to reinforce the topic you are being asked to write about.

## Críoch

Bheul, caithfidh mé imeacht anois. Tá mé ag dul amach le mo chlann. Abair le don chlann go raibh mé ag chuir a dtuairisce. Scríobh chugam le casadh an phoist. Táim ag tnúth go mór le do litir.



**Translation**: Well I have to go now. I am going out with my family. Tell your family I was asking for them. Write to me soon.

**Note**: If you are writing to your family, change 'dul amach le mo chlann' to something like 'dul amach le mo chairde'. You may also have to change 'don chlann' to 'gach duine'.
