```
Shantaigh sé bean
i nead a chine,
faoiseamh is gean
ar leac a thine,
aiteas is greann
i dtógáil chlainne.

Shantaigh sí fear
is taobh den bhríste,
dídean is searc
is leath den chíste,
saoire thar lear
is meas na mílte.

Thángthas ar réiteach.
Scaradar
```

## Translation

```
He desired a woman
In their own nest/home/place,
releif and love
around the fire,
happiness and fun
raising a family.

She desired a man
Half the pants (equality),
Shelter and a loving husband
half the cake (she wants the best of everything),
Holidays abroad
respect of thousands.

A solution was reached
they seperated.
```
