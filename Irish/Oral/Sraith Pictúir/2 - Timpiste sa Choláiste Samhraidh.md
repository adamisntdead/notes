Thug na tuismitheoirí síob dá gcuid páistí go dtí an Ghaeltacht. D’fhág siad slán acu agus d’imigh siad abhaile ina ngluaisteáin. Bhí na déagóirí chun cúrsa a dhéanamh sa choláiste samhraidh i gCiarraí. Triúr buachaillí a bhí sa ghrúpa agus bhí málaí droma orthu.

**Translation:**
The parents gave their children a lift to the Gaeltacht. They said goodbye to them and they went home in their car. The boys were doing a course in the summer college in Kerry. There was three boys in the group, and they had backpacks.

Sa chéad phictiúr bhí buachaillí ag imirt cluiche peile. Bhí an aimsir go hálainn. Bhí an pháirc peile suite cois na farraige agus bhí bád seoil amuigh ar an bhfarraige. Go tobann lig buachaill amháin scread as agus thit sé ar an talamh. Bhí greim aige ar a chos agus bhí sé soiléir go raibh sé i bpian go mór. Bhí an chuma ar an scéal gur ghortaigh sé a chos agus é ag imirt peile.
