# An Gnáthrud - Achoimre

Jimmy was drinking in a pub in Belfast with his friends. He thought of his beautiful wife, trying to put the kids to bed. Jimmy wasn't happy to be drinking, but Sarah told him to go, for fear that they would think he was under her control.

Jimmy ordered drinks for his friends, but Billy only wanted a small one. Jimmy thought this was funny - he knew that billy would be sitting in the bar until the end of the night. Billy was not getting on well on the building site, and Jimmy organized to help him. Jimmy looked at the other men in the bar. He didn't understand why the drinkers didn't want to go home. He was happy out to go home. 

He had a four-year-old son, and twins born six months ago. They had a nice, comfortable house as well. They only paid four thousand for the house, but they did it up nicely. Jimmy left because he wanted to see his family. It was a cold night. He went to the Chinese restaurant (The Jasmine Palace).

There were rude and drunk teenagers. Liz, a single mother, was working behind the counter. She said to Jimmy that this wasn't common/usual. This embarrassed him because he felt pity for her. A teenager came over to Jimmy, looking for money. He gave him some change, but the rogue didn't even thank him. Jimmy heard the harsh talk from the young lads. He didn't like it at all.

He got the food and started the short journey home.  He got a curry for himself and chop suey for Sarah. He put the food under his arm to keep it warm. He was thinking of his lovely wife when a car came with no lights. Suddenly, a young man shot a gun and killed Jimmy. He was left lying in the street and his blood was mixing with the food he had gotten.



## Téama an scéil

This story deals with violence in the north and family life. Jimmy is a huge family man, that is very happy with his wife. We don't know why Jimmy was shot. But maybe a catholic family left the house that Jimmy and Sarah bought. There is a chance they are protestants, because the twins names are Elizabeth and Margret. Maybe that's the reason that he was shot at the end of the story. 



## Charachters in the story

**Jimmy**: We don't find out much about Jimmy's life. But we get a good picture of what type of person he is. He is a kind, thoughtful and clever person. He has a lot of love. When he was in the pub, he was thinking of his family and he would like to spend the evening with them. We see that he is a nice, understanding person. He orginizes to help his friend Billy on the building site when he finds out he is in trouble. He felt pity for Liz in the chinese restraunt also. He doesn't drink too much and works hard for the family. 

**Sarah** is a young, beautfiul mother. She is understanding. She lets Jimmy go out when she is working in the house. Sarah is a proud woman, because she doesn't want Jimmys friends to think that she controls her man. She is happy with her life, and she has a nice, cosy house for her young family. 



## Opinion

I really enjoyed this short story. The writers gives a good account of the troubles. I love the charachter of Jimmy. There is a special love between his family. I enjoy that. The reader has respect for him, and that is why the end scares us. It is a terible murder, because he is a nice man, who loves his family
