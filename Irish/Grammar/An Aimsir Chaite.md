# An Aimsir Chaite, The Past Tense

There are two things you must do before conjugating a verb.

1. Check if the verb is broad or slender (leathan nÃ³ caol).
  
## Is a Verb Slender or Broad?

Look at the last vowel,

If a verb has two or more syllables, you must take the existing ending off (for example, ceannaigh -> ceann).

| Type    | Letter  |
| ------- | ------- |
| Leathan | a, o, u |
| Caol    | i, e    |
