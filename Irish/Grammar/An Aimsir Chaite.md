# An Aimsir Chaite, The Past Tense

There are three things you must do to conjugate a verb.

1. Check if the verb is broad or slender (leathan nó caol).
2. Who is doing this? (mé, tú, sé, sí, sinn, sibh, siad)
3. The ending?

If the verb has more then on syllable, you must remove the ending, put the new ending on the verb.

There are two categories within the multiple syllable categories. 

There is those that end in 'aigh' and 'igh' (e.g. ceannaigh, éirigh).
Remove the ending, and then put it on, ceann~~aigh~~, éir~~igh~~. Then put on the ending.

The other type is those like freagair and codail.
They usually end in ail, aim, and air.

Take the ai or i from the end, and put the ending there.

  
## Is a Verb Slender or Broad?

Look at the last vowel,

If a verb has two or more syllables, you must take the existing ending off (for example, ceannaigh -> ceann).

| Type    | Letter  |
| ------- | ------- |
