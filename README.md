# School Notes

> My notes for 5th and 6th year, immortalized in git 

## How This Looks

There is a folder for each subject, and the folder may be subdivided also into either category, year or topic.

The notes will be written with math as latex, for example a quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and it's solution:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

## How To Edit This

First, you should clone it:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adamisntdead/notes.git
```

Then you can edit it in any text editor. I would recommend a plugin/editor
that supports using LaTeX in the preview.
